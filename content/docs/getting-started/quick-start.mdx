# Quick Start

This guide walks through creating an account, starting your first story, and inviting a collaborator.

## 1. Create an Account

Axelot supports three sign-in methods:

- **Google OAuth** -- One-click sign-in with your Google account
- **GitHub OAuth** -- Sign in with your GitHub account
- **Email and Password** -- Create credentials-based account with email verification

Visit [/auth/sign-up](/auth/sign-up) to get started. OAuth accounts are ready immediately. Email accounts require clicking a verification link before you can sign in.

## 2. Set Up Your Profile

After signing in, visit [/settings](/settings) to configure your profile:

- **Username** -- Choose a unique username (3-20 characters). This creates your public profile URL at `/u/@username`.
- **Bio** -- Write a short description (up to 160 characters) visible on your profile.

Your display name and avatar are pulled from your OAuth provider.

## 3. Create a Story

Navigate to [My Stories](/stories) and click **New Story**. Enter a title in the dialog and your story opens in the editor.

The editor supports rich formatting:

- Text styling (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
- Headings (H1 through H4)
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables, blockquotes, and horizontal rules
- LaTeX math equations
- Mermaid diagrams

Changes save automatically as you type.

## 4. Publish Your Story

By default, stories are private. Toggle the **Public/Private** switch in the story header to publish. Public stories:

- Appear in the [Discover](/discover) feed
- Are accessible to anyone with the link
- Accumulate view counts that feed into the trending algorithm

Your public story URL follows the pattern: `/u/@username/storyId-slug`

## 5. Invite Collaborators

Click the **Share** button in the story header to invite other users:

- Search by email address or @username
- Assign a role: **Viewer** (read-only) or **Editor** (can edit in real time)
- Editors appear in the story's author list and can see each other's cursors
