# Welcome to Axelot

Axelot is a collaborative storytelling platform that combines real-time editing, AI-powered writing assistance, and social discovery. Built with Next.js 16, Firebase, and Yjs CRDTs.

## Core Features

**Real-Time Collaboration**
Edit stories simultaneously with other writers. Changes merge automatically using conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) over encrypted WebRTC peer connections.

**AI Writing Assistance**
Get intelligent text completions and transformations powered by OpenRouter. The AI assists without replacing the creative process.

**Discovery Feed**
A trending algorithm surfaces popular stories based on view count, recency, and engagement. Browse by trending, fresh, or all stories.

**Rich Text Editor**
A full-featured TipTap editor with syntax-highlighted code blocks, LaTeX math, Mermaid diagrams, tables, and 35+ extensions.

**Access Controls**
Invite collaborators with read or write access. Publish stories publicly or keep them private. Archive stories you want to set aside.
